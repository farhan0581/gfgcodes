Djkastras algo work for graph without negative weight
for negative weight cycle, it gives TLE

time = E*logV


bellman ford algorithm helps to detect negative weight cycle
It works only on directed graph, for undirected graphs, you have to represent them as directed graphs
time = E*V


Floyd Warshall
It is multi source shortest path algorithm
we use adjacency matrix for this.

Minimum spanning tree:
- In which we have n nodes and n-1 edges and all nodes are reachable from each other.
- The tree which has mimimum sum of the edge weights is the MST of a graph 

Disjoint set:
It helps to merge dynamically the components, because at every stage the graph changes.
