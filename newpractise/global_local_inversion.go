/*
Problem statement
For a given integer array/list 'ARR' of size 'N' containing all distinct values, find the total number of 'Inversions' that may exist.

An inversion is defined for a pair of integers in the array/list when the following two conditions are met.

A pair ('ARR[i]', 'ARR[j]') is said to be an inversion when:

1. 'ARR[i] > 'ARR[j]'
2. 'i' < 'j'

Where 'i' and 'j' denote the indices ranging from [0, 'N').
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= ARR[i] <= 10^9

Where 'ARR[i]' denotes the array element at 'ith' index.

Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1 :
3
3 2 1
Sample Output 1 :
3
Explanation of Sample Output 1:
We have a total of 3 pairs which satisfy the condition of inversion. (3, 2), (2, 1) and (3, 1).
Sample Input 2 :
5
2 5 1 3 4
Sample Output 2 :
4
Explanation of Sample Output 1:
We have a total of 4 pairs which satisfy the condition of inversion. (2, 1), (5, 1), (5, 3) and (5, 4).



since there are 0 to n-1 elemetns in array of size n,
every global inversion is also a local inversion, the problem is when a global inversion holds for more
than local inversion, so if the number is moved away more than 1 position
