+---------------+---------+
(movie_id, user_id) is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the rating of a movie by a user in their review.
created_at is the users review date. 
 

Write a solution to:

Find the name of the user who has rated the greatest number of movies. In case of a tie, return the lexicographically smaller user name.
Find the movie name with the highest average rating in February 2020. In case of a tie, return the lexicographically smaller movie name.
The result format is in the following example.


union all -> contain duplicates
union -> eliminate duplicates
(select u.name as results from Users as u join MovieRating as r on u.user_id=r.user_id group by r.user_id order by count(r.user_id) desc,u.name limit 1) 
union all 
(select m.title as results from Movies as m join MovieRating as r on m.movie_id=r.movie_id where r.created_at >= '2020-02-01' and r.created_at <= '2020-02-29' group by r.movie_id order by avg(r.rating) desc, m.title limit 1)

Table: RequestAccepted

+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| requester_id   | int     |
| accepter_id    | int     |
| accept_date    | date    |
+----------------+---------+
(requester_id, accepter_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the ID of the user who sent the request, the ID of the user who received the request, and the date when the request was accepted.
 

Write a solution to find the people who have the most friends and the most friends number.

The test cases are generated so that only one person has the most friends.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
RequestAccepted table:
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| 1            | 2           | 2016/06/03  |
| 1            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 2            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 3            | 4           | 2016/06/09  |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
Output: 
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 3  | 3   |
+----+-----+
Explanation: 
The person with id 3 is a friend of people 1, 2, and 4, so he has three friends in total, which is the most number than any others.
 

Follow up: In the real world, multiple people could have the same most number of friends. Could you find all these people in this case?
